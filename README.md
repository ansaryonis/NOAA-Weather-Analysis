1.) Calculate the yearly average temperature for each lake and the annual average for all six lakes combined.

2.) Indicate which lake is the coldest and which one is the warmest, based on the average yearly temperatures calculated in step #1. Also, indicate which lakes have average temperatures above the average of all and which are below that same average.<br />

3.) Indicate the day and the temperature for the warmest water temperatures for each of the lakes. Do the same for the coldest temperatures.

4.) Find the warmest and coldest water temperatures, dates, and specified temperatures.

5.) Calculate the summer average for all lakes and display the names of the lakes in order from warmest to coldest. Compare to the yearly average.

6.) Calculate the winter average for all lakes and display the names of the lakes in order from warmest to coldest. Compare to the yearly average.

7.) Using the swim-appropriate temperature of 20 degrees >, calculate the number of days in the year you can swim for each lake.

8.) Using a frozen water temperature of < 0 degrees, calculate the number of days in the year that the lake is frozen for each lake.

9.) Re-do question 1 but with data from 2019 instead. Compare and contrast between 2020
